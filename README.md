# dotfiles
This is a quirky little collection of all my dotfiles  
I hope you enjoy the quirky characterizations I wrote for each command in the .bashrc at 1 AM

2:08 AM Edit: I just realized I spend 7-9 hours editing a .bashrc...

**Install:**
Make that directory until I make it so you don't have to
```sh
mkdir coding_projects
cd coding_projects
git clone https://github.com/5Stygian/dotfiles.git
cd ~/
updfs pull
```

**Update:**
```sh 
updfs pull
```
