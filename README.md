# dotfiles
This is a quirky little collection of all my dotfiles.
I hope you enjoy the quirky characterizations I wrote for each command in the .bashrc at 1 AM.

2:08 AM Edit: I just realized I spend 7-9 hours editing a .bashrc...

**Install:**
Download and run ``install.sh``. **UNTESTED**  
Note: This is only tested on Windows 11 Git Bash

**Update:**  
Note: This command is in .bash_profile so it is ran automatically every time you open a bash terminal
```sh 
updfs pull
```
